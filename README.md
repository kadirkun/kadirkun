# Hello stranger! 
Here, you are warmly welcomed to my sweet sweet GitHub profile. 
You can understand what am I doing and what are my interests in computer manners.

But I can help you to get those impressions:
* I'm currently working on age prediction and distributed spiking neural networks.
* I'm wanna work on distributed computing, artificial intelligence, and data science/engineering topics.
* I used to interest in near hardware topics like FPGA, low-level programming, CPU design, and Assembly programming and I still got the blues for it.
